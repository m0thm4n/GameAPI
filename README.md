Video Game API for .Net Blue Badge Project 
Created by Team Purple (Nathan Moritz, Kyle Johnson, and Blake Kendall)

This API allows you access information about video games. There are different endpoints for the four major video game platforms: Xbox One, Playstation 4, PC, and Nintendo Switch. The foreign keys relate back to the Developer and Publisher for each video game.

Information needed when creating new videos games includes a Name or Title, a rating (expressed as a double), a price, a Maturity Rating (ex. E, 10+, T, M, etc), a genre, a developer id (a Foreign Key), and a publisher id (a second Foreign Key).

The database has been pre-seeded with the top ten best-selling video games for each platform (according to Wikipedia, see links below for those lists), along with their corresponding developers and publishers. Since a developer and publisher will be needed when creating a new video game, here are the existing pre-seeded Foreign Keys for reference (more can be added through the CRUD enpoints for Developer and Publisher respectively):
